# The AirBnB Clone Project
========================

## Description of the Project
--------------------------

This is the first step towards building our first full web application: the **AirBnB clone**. This first step is very important because we'll use what we build during this project with all other following projects which includes: *I'll remove this*:

>> HTML/CSS Templating
>> Database Storage
>> Apllication Programming Interface (API)
>> Front-end Integration

and so on. The final goal of the project is to deploy on our server the copy of the **AirBnB website**.

But we won't implement all the features here, only some of them to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track we've learnt in ALX.
