# The AirBnB Clone Project
========================

## Description of the Project

This is the first step towards building our first full web application: the **AirBnB clone**. This first step is very important because we'll use what we build during this project with all other following projects which includes:

	- HTML/CSS Templating
	- Database Storage
	- Apllication Programming Interface (API)
	- Front-end Integration

and so on. The final goal of the project is to deploy on our server the copy of the [**AirBnB website**](https://airbnb.com "A full website").

But we won't implement all the features here, only some of them to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track we've learnt in ALX.

## Description of the Command Interpreter

The interface of the application is just like the Bash shell except that this has a limited number of accepted commands that were solely defined for the purposes of the usage of the AirBnB website.

This command line interpreter serves as the frontend of the web app where users can interact with the backend which was developed with python OOP programming.

Some of the commands available are:

	* show
	* create
	* update
	* destroy
	* count

And as part of the implementation of the command line interpreter coupled with the backend and file storage system, the folowing actions can be performed:

	* Creating new objects (ex: a new User or a new Place)
	* Retrieving an object from a file, a database etc…
	* Doing operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
	* Updating attributes of an object
	* Destroying an object
